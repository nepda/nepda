# 👋 Hi, I'm Nepomuk

I'm a backend-focused PHP developer from Germany, working with Laravel and Domain-Driven Design.  
I enjoy building pragmatic tools and clean, reliable systems on Linux (Ubuntu).

- 🐘 PHP 8+, Laravel, MariaDB  
- ⚙️ Docker, Linux, Bash  
- 🏗️ Software Architecture & Domain-Driven Design  
  *Applying DDD to design maintainable and modular systems*

Always curious. Always shipping.
